Pika - tdwsl 2023

Pika is a simple language that compiles to bytecode. It has no types, but
supports the use of both byte and word (32 bits) arrays by using a separate
index operator for each. It's easy to parse, and compiles in a single pass.

I created it to try writing a 'compiler'. Even though it only compiles to
bytecode for now, I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out.
